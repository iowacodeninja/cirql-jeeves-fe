# Todo

This is where Christa keeps a list of things that need to be done still:

- detail page: 
    - click on image pops up a modal
    - click on a text field turns it into a form field
- search results
    - submitting the search form doesn't append the search param
    - search results path doesn't show the move list

These are the features already "done":
- detail page: 
    - carousel/caption styling
- desktop design and routing:
    - homepage
    - search results page
    - move category page
    - move detail page

- detail page
    - edit styling
    - edit behavior
    - edit data hookup

What if we hooked up a Google Form to the spreadsheet as a beginner edit/auth system

I was thinking a Google Sheet with the move info, and then a Google Drive folder with all the media, joined on an id (the filename).
