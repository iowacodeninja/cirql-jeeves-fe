# CirQl Jeeves Back-end

# Todo

This is where Christa keeps a list of things that need to be done still:

- detail page: 
    - carousel/caption styling
- search results
    - submitting the search form doesn't append the search param
    - search results path doesn't show the move list

These are the features already "done":
- desktop design and routing:
    - homepage
    - search results page
    - move category page
    - move detail page
